# SpartaWebApp

A sparta themed web application which contains pages for student user profiles and their corresponding trainers.
Comprised of data held in an ASP.NET API back-end with React used to build the user interface to interact with the data.

### Sprint Log
## Sprint 0
We started off sprint 0 with our initial planning, which consisted of requirement gathering, Database relationship planning using LucidChart and creating User Stories through epics and features that were to be included. We used a *Github Project board* to group our user stories according to the user requirement.

We created our User Stories after we had spoken to our prodduct owner who had let us know what product they were looking for, along with what sorts of features they wanted and how they wanted it laid out. With a provided wireframe it gave us a clear indicator on how they wanted it to look as well. Our project was to create a web page that contained a search function, a filter function, tiles per trainee that had a video profile as well as an image and bio for each trainee. After we discussed and made sure we had a clear idea of what was expected, we started writing user stories to create a backlog.

## Sprint planning
In our sprint planning, we split up into teams to help us attack this task correctly. For our first sprint we decided we would start basic and one team would make an MVC page that just has the layout, without the functionality as sprint 1. We also decided that we would have the other team create the same page using React, as we felt this would look cleaner for the overall product. 

## Sprint 1 Actual
We set ourselves a timeframe of 5pm (16/03/20) - 10am (17/03/20) to complete this sprint, where team 1 would start the MVC page with correct layout but no functionality, and team 2 would do the same but in React. We used the requirements to guide us and create a product to show the product owner at the end of this sprint, to ensure we are heading in the right direction.

## Sprint Review

We created the database, after writing out an SQL query to create our initial database. We then scaffolded our DB context to create our model classes, as well as add controllers to help us view, edit and delete data from the database. In addition to this, we edited the according files so that we could load an initial page when running a project, and pushed everything back up to Github as our first iteration.

## Getting Started

Clone the project from github and run the SQL query to create the SpartaDB.
